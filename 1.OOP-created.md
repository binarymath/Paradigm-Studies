# When created OOP ? #

The concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, and various programming languages and systems were developed during that time which laid the foundation for OOP. However, the term "object-oriented programming" itself was coined in the 1960s by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard in their work on the Simula programming language, which is widely considered to be the first object-oriented language.

Simula, developed in the 1960s at the NCC (Norwegian Computing Center) in Oslo, Norway, was designed to support simulation and modeling. It introduced the concept of classes and objects, and allowed for the creation of objects with their own state and behavior, encapsulating data and methods. Simula is considered to be the first language that provided the key features of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

In the following decades, other programming languages such as Smalltalk, C++, Eiffel, and Java were developed, which further popularized and refined the concepts of OOP. Smalltalk, developed in the 1970s at Xerox PARC, is often considered to be the first pure object-oriented language, as it implemented the ideas of objects, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism in a complete and consistent way.

C++, developed in the 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup, combined object-oriented features with the existing C programming language, and became widely popular for systems programming and application development. Java, developed in the 1990s by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, brought OOP to the mainstream and is widely used for various applications, including enterprise systems, web development, and mobile app development.

Since then, the object-oriented paradigm has become one of the most popular programming paradigms and is widely used in many programming languages and frameworks, providing a powerful and flexible way to organize and structure code.
